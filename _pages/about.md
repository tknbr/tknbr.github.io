Welcome to my blog about Artificial Intelligence! My name is Arnau and I am a computer scientist from Barcelona. I started my career working on embedded systems, learning to program, focusing on optimizing computing power and shrinking memory space. I recently developed an interest in Artificial Intelligence and started to learn as much as possible about it! I will use this blog to post about everything I find interesting and to share small projects I develop to further my knowledge.
