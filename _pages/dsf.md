I find it common for everybody, starting with data science problems, to skip all the basic steps and move forward to create new models immediately. To resolve this issue, I always encourage others to take this simple approach:

1. **Define the problem**. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design and design before technology.

2. **Gather the data**. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, we live in an age where data is probably already collected somewhere. Locate your source and plan a strategy to gather it.

3. **Prepare data for consumption**. Once we have the data, we must process, extract and clean it before we can use it. 

    3.1. **[Importing libraries](/importing-libraries/)**  
    3.2. **[Meet & greet the data](/meet-and-greet-data/)**  
    3.3 **[The 4 Cs: Correct, complete, create and convert](/the-4-cs/)**  
    3.4 **[Dividing the data into train and test](/train-test)**  

4. **Explore the data (EDA)**. Use statistic methods to find potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and computations on the data.

    4.1. **[Effect of multicollinearity](/effect-of-multicollinearity/)**  
    4.2. **[Pearsonâ€™s correlation of coefficient](/pearson/)**  

5. **Model the data**. The set of data and expected outcomes will determine which algorithms to use. Choosing a bad model can lead, in the best case, to poor performance and, in the worst case, to a bad conclusion.

6. **Validate**. This step will be used to look for signs of overfitting, under fitting or generalization and to obtain the model's performance.

7. **Optimize**. Iterate through the whole process to make it better and more robust.
