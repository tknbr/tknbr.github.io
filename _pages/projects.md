# Computer vision mushroom specie idenfifier

A common hobby among the people of my country is trying to find some species of mushrooms (fungi) while walking through the forest. There are more than 60 different species within 50 km of my hometown. It is thus essential to correctly identify those that are edible and those that are not. This project aims to identify mushroom species from photographs using artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. [See more!](/mushrooms)

# Pulmonary Fibrosis Evolution using Machine Learning

Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease that causes irreversible damage to the lung. The mean life expectancy of patients is 3.8 years, but prompt diagnosis and early treatment can increase life expectancy up to 5 years. The goal of this project is to explore the personalized evolution of patients using machine learning techniques. [See more!](/pulmonary-fibrosis)
