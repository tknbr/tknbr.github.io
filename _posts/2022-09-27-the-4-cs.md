title: The 4 Cs&#58; Correct, Complete, Create and Convert

Data collected in real-life situations can contain errors or gaps. Trying to build a model directly with this data without first being filtered and corrected can lead to a poor performance start. With the four Cs, you can avoid these problems and easily transform the dataset to build a much more robust model in the future:

* **Correct**. The first step will be to identify anomalies in the existing data as outliers. This will be a visual task as one needs to be familiar with the parameters being checked. Panda's function [describe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) may be useful to find these outliers and, if necessary, will be deleted from the dataset.

```python
# Descriptive statistics include those that
# summarize the central tendency, dispersion
# and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, 
# excluding NaN values
print(df.describe()['list', 'of', 'parameters'])
```

* **Complete**. Second step of the workflow will be to complete the missing information gaps of the dataset. Panda's function [isnull](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isnull.html) will return a list of all params in the dataset and the number of rows that contain empty data.

```python
# Detect missing values.
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

* **Create**.

* **Convert**.
