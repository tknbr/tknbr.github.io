When working with python it is common to use third party libraries. Libraries are a collection of modules containing bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. This modules makes it easier and conveninet for programmers as we don't need to write the same code over and over again. When preparing the data for consumption we can make us of the following libraries:

- **Pandas**. A collection of functions to process and analyze data.
- **Numpy**. A collection of functions to operate vectors and matrix.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**. A collection of functions to visualization of the data.
- **Scipy**. A collection of functions used in cientific and mathematic computation.
- **Sklearn**. A collection of machine learning algorithms.

The above mentioned libraries can be imported using the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import scipy as sp
import sklearn as sk
```
